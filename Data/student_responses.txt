Light goes in your eye. It bounces around and you can then see stuff.

Light reflects off of an object and it enters your eyes. It enters through the cornea and into the pupil. After moving through the pupil it is refracted and focused by the lens. An image is projected on the cornea which it is upside down. That image is sent from the blind spot on the retina through the optic nerve to the brain which flips the message right side up.
The iris is stationed on the outside of the pupil, and is the muscle that gives you the ability to make the pupil smaller or larger in change of light.
The pupil is the black hole in the middle of your eye it allows the image to go into the lens. The lens refracts the light to make an upside down image on the back if the retina. The retina is the holder of the rods and cones. The rods help you to see black and white and the cones enable you to see color. The optic nerve send the image to the brain which flips it so you can see right side up.
